# boschMobilityHackathon
Project I created in 24 hours at Bosch Mobility Hackathon that visualizes Chicago CTA data on Google Maps

The file boschAccess.py reads in text files containing CTA data, then generates HTML files with the data
overlayed as a heat map on Google Maps. With this program, you can visualize various statistics of the 
data which is beneficial for policy makers and analysts.
